          To operate, first click on the moon icon in the top right corner of the screen. This will launch a popup. 
          From there, select from the following three modes: 
          <br>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Dark mode:
              <ul>
                <li> 
                  This will change the background color of the site to a dark grey and the text to light grey, 
                  borders to a medium-dark grey, and any containers (such as the background of the popup) to a medium grey. </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              High Contrast mode:
              <ul>
                <li> 
                  This will change the background color of the site to a light grey, the text to a dark grey, 
                  borders to a medium-light grey, and any containers to a medium grey.
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Custom Palette: 
              <ul>
                <li>
                  From here, choose the colors you want to set by typing in the hexadecimal codes for the colors, leaving 
                  off the #. Then click submit, and the palette will be saved for your current session.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
          When you are done, click on the icon again to close the popup.

          those who have vision impairments (like User A from deliverable 1) or who tend to avoid bright 
          screens due to headaches or other difficulties (like Users B and C from deliverable 1).

      <h2>Usability Test Procedure:</h2>
      <div class="wrapper">
        <div>
          For the usability test, 1-2 examiners are required. They should need a computer to run the program on, a phone or 
          other device for timing and documenting, and something to take notes on (ie a notebook). The prototype should be 
          handled according to the user manual, and the page should be refreshed before the user tests it. The examiners 
          should proceed by giving the user the prototype and user manuual, starting a stopwatch, and then instructing them 
          to open the extension. Once the extension is open, the users should be instructed to turn on dark mode, then high 
          contrast mode, and then create a custom palette with a green background, blue text, yellow containers, and red 
          borders. Examiners should tell the test subjects that they may use outside tools to find the hex codes for each 
          of the colors. The examiners should avoid showing the test subjects any of the operation of the prototype and 
          they should avoid telling the test subjects what to do in any more detail than is explained here, instead directing 
          them to the user manual. The examiners should measure the number of tries it takes to open the extension, the total 
          amount of time taken to open the extension and turn on all three modes, including making a new custom palette, as 
          well as record any questions the test subjects may ask.

          A heuristic evaluation should be implemented, focusing on the heuristics of Visibility of System Status, 
          Match between System and the Real World, and Aesthetic and Minimalist Design from Nielsen's list. 
          The evaluators should be given detailed explanations of what these heuristics mean, and then provide feedback 
          as to how the interface does or does not effectively implement them. Additionally, if they have any other 
          comments on the interface, they should also include those in their evaluation.
