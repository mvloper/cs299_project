          To operate, first click on the moon icon in the top right corner of the screen. This will launch a popup. 
          From there, select from the following three modes: 
          <br>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Dark mode:
              <ul>
                <li> 
                  This will change the background color of the site to a dark grey and the text to light grey, 
                  borders to a medium-dark grey, and any containers (such as the background of the popup) to a medium grey. </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              High Contrast mode:
              <ul>
                <li> 
                  This will change the background color of the site to a light grey, the text to a dark grey, 
                  borders to a medium-light grey, and any containers to a medium grey.
              </ul>
            </li>

              Custom Palette: 
              <ul>
                <li>
                  From here, choose the colors you want to set by typing in the hexadecimal codes for the colors, leaving 
                  off the #. Then click submit, and the palette will be saved for your current session.

      <h2>Usability Test Procedure:</h2>
      <div class="wrapper">
        <div>
          For the usability test, 1-2 examiners are required. They should need a computer to run the program on, a phone or 
          other device for timing and documenting, and something to take notes on (ie a notebook). The prototype should be 
          handled according to the user manual, and the page should be refreshed before the user tests it. The examiners 
          should proceed by giving the user the prototype and user manuual, starting a stopwatch, and then instructing them 
          to open the extension. Once the extension is open, the users should be instructed to turn on dark mode, then high 
          contrast mode, and then create a custom palette with a green background, blue text, yellow containers, and red 
          borders. Examiners should tell the test subjects that they may use outside tools to find the hex codes for each 
          of the colors. The examiners should avoid showing the test subjects any of the operation of the prototype and 
          they should avoid telling the test subjects what to do in any more detail than is explained here, instead directing 
          them to the user manual. The examiners should measure the number of tries it takes to open the extension, the total 
          amount of time taken to open the extension and turn on all three modes, including making a new custom palette, as 
          well as record any questions the test subjects may ask.

          A heuristic evaluation should be implemented, focusing on the heuristics of Visibility of System Status, 
          Match between System and the Real World, and Aesthetic and Minimalist Design from Nielsen's list. 
          The evaluators should be given detailed explanations of what these heuristics mean, and then provide feedback 
          as to how the interface does or does not effectively implement them. Additionally, if they have any other 
          comments on the interface, they should also include those in their evaluation.

          All of the users we tested use computers regularly, and are therefore in the target audience of our project.
          <h3>User A:</h3>
          Usability test: 
          <ul>
            <li>Took 1 try to launch the extension</li>
            <li>Took 3 minutes and 57 seconds to perform all of the requested tasks</li>
            <li>When adding the custom colors, got somewhat confused as to what format the colors should be in - was unfamiliar with hexadecimal colors.</li>
          </ul>
          Heuristic Evaluation:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Visibility of System Status:
              <ul>
                <li>User A thought that it overall was good, however, was curious as to whether there was a default or normal mode</li>
                <li>"Is there no 'normal' mode?"</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Match between System and the Real World:
              <ul>
                <li>User A had never heard of hex colors before, and suggested that there be more explanation of those</li>
                <li>"Another thought would be maybe if you put in a hyperlink in the user manual to a hexadecimal color chooser... I wasn't sure 
                  whether to put the names of the colors, or just the numbers"</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Aesthetic and Minimalist Design:
              <ul>
                <li>User A did not think there was anything wrong with the design elements and the layout.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3> User B</h3>
          Usablilty Test:
          <ul>
            <li>Took 1 try to launch the extension</li>
            <li>Took 2 minutes and 2 seconds to perform all of the requested tasks</li>
          </ul>
          Heuristic Evaluation: 
          <ul>
            <li>
              Visibility of System Status:
              <ul>
                <li>User B thought it was good overall</li>
                <li>"I think that's good, because you have the highlight of which one is selected, so that's clear to me"</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Match between System and the Real World:
              <ul>
                <li>User B had some confusion about what the containers were in the custom colors menu before inputting a color</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Aesthetic and Minimalist Design:
              <ul>
                <li>While they knew from the manual that the moon icon was the button to launch the extension, User B thought that the button could have been more clear</li>
                <li>"I think the button is a bit vague"</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>User C:</h3>
          Usability test: 
          <ul>
            <li>Took 2 tries to launch the extension</li>
            <li>Took 4 minutes and 46 seconds to perform all of the requested tasks</li>
            <li>Got confused about how to add colors, what code to enter.</li>
          </ul>
          Heuristic Evaluation:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Visibility of System Status:
              <ul>
                <li>User C thought the visibility was good but said to add a hashtag before the colors so it is more clear what type of code you are entering.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Match between System and the Real World:
              <ul>
                <li>User C was able to access a color picker, but did not know which was hex code (as opposed to RGB) so that was confusing.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Aesthetic and Minimalist Design:
              <ul>
                <li>User C did not see any issues with the design or layout.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>User D:</h3>
          Usability test: 
          <ul>
            <li>Took 1 try to launch the extension</li>
            <li>Took 1 minute and 12 seconds to perform all of the requested tasks</li>
          </ul>
          Heuristic Evaluation:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Visibility of System Status:
              <ul>
                <li>User D thought that the extension popup changing colors to match the rest of the theme would lead to problems if you set everything to one color, since then you wouldn't be able to see the extension and change it back to normal, which would cause major issues.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Match between System and the Real World:
              <ul>
                <li>User D did not see any issues here.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Aesthetic and Minimalist Design:
              <ul>
                <li>User D thought the checkboxes were "weird" and should be circles as that is more common. They also said "the UI is too big". </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Analysis</h3>
          Overall, users were generally able to complete the benchmark tasks with ease. In terms of heuristics, there was some confusion with relation to the terminology of 
          hexadecimal colors and what 'containers' were. <br>
