The use case scenario provides a comprehensive and informative
description of user interaction with the proposed system and clearly
explains how it addresses the user's need.

With our browser extension installed, a user could select options to make a website darker 
by turning background elements dark gray and text/icons bright. Or they could make

Our extension would provide multiple solutions to issues of websites causing eye strain 
or being difficult to read.
