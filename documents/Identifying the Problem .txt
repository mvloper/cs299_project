Identifying the Problem: 

The problem we have observed is the lack of dark mode or high contrast mode 
on various commonly used websites, such as Google Drive (see fig. 1), which lacks both, 
and Canvas (see fig. 2), which has a high contrast mode, but not a dark mode. This causes 
issues, such as headaches when looking at a bright screen for too long, or the inabiity to 
easily read text without high contrast. Our project would implement a browser extension 
that would create dark mode and/or high contrast mode for websites that do not natively 
have one.
