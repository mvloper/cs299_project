      high contrast mode to websites. Our goal is to make them easier to read/use without

        <div>
        James, one of our personas, installs our extension so he can use the high contrast 
        features it promises. They go to the Firefox add-ons page and add our extension to 
        their browser. Once it is added, they navigate to a website that they normally 
        wouldn't be able to access, click the extensions menu on their browser header, and
        select our extension. A pop-up appears on their screen with options to turn on 
        dark mode and high contrast mode. They select to turn on high-contrast mode, which 
        immediately changes the colors on the web page to make them have a much higher level of 
        contrast, with a white background and black or blue text and icons. This allows James to 
        easily read the text on this page, which they normally would struggle with.
        
        Mim, our other persona, installs our extension through the same process as James, but they
        do it so that they can use the dark mode feature and get fewer headaches from the bright
        screen they look at all day. When they select the extension, instead of turning on high-contrast
        mode, they turn on dark mode, which immediately makes the background of the page they are 
        looking at dark gray and the text and icons bright, thus making it easier for them to look
        at for a longer time. </div>
